Upstream-Name: beats
Source: https://github.com/elastic/beats
 The source code in this package was imported from the above URL at commit ref
 `fec835c970c0d2ea34f483c238a1d13be51428f8`, and was "filtered" using the
 following command to remove other files which were superfluous to successfully
 building the Journalbeat utility, except if otherwise required (e.g. under the
 terms of any applicable license):
 .
 git filter-branch --tree-filter 'for f in $(ls -a | grep -v journalbeat |\
 grep -v libbeat | grep -v filebeat | grep -v vendor | grep -v \.$ | grep -v\
 \.\.$ | gre p -iv license | grep -v NOTICE.txt | grep -v .gitignore); do rm\
 -rf $f; done' --prune-empty -f
 .
 In addition to removing the superfluous code, the filter also removed code
 which is licensed under the "Elastic License Agreement", a copy of which is
 included under the `licenses/` directory of this source.
